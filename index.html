        <strong>Front end: </strong>
        <p>
            It is the visible part of website or web application which is responsible for user experience. The user
            directly
            interacts with the front end portion of the web application or website.
        </p><br>
        <strong> Front end Languages: </strong>
        <p>
            The front end portion is built by using some languages which are discussed below:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>HTML: </strong>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is used to design the front end
                portion of web pages using markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language.
                Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. The markup language is used to define the text
                documentation within tag which defines the structure of web pages.
                <br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>CSS: </strong>Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language
                intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.
                <br>
                CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of
                the
                HTML that makes up each web page.

            </li>
            <li>

        <strong>Back end: </strong>It refers to the server-side development of web application or website with a primary
        focus on how the website works. It is responsible for managing the database through queries and APIs by
        client-side
        commands. This type of website mainly consists of three parts front end, back end, and database. The back end
        portion is built by using some libraries, frameworks, and languages which are discussed below:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>JavaScript: </strong>Javascript can be used as both (front end and back end) programming
                languages.

                <strong>Node.js: </strong>Node.js is an open source and cross-platform runtime environment for executing
                JavaScript code outside of a browser.
                <br>

                <br>
                We often use Node.js for building back-end services like APIs like Web App or Mobile App. It’s used in
                production by large companies such as Paypal,
                <br>
                Uber, Netflix, Wallmart and so on.

                systems
                more efficiently.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Database: </strong>Database is the collection of inter-related data which helps in efficient retrieval,
        insertion and deletion of data from database and organizes the data

                <strong>MongoDB: </strong>MongoDB, the most popular NoSQL database, is an open source document-oriented
                database. The term ‘NoSQL’ means ‘non-relational’. It means that MongoDB isn’t based on the table-like
                relational database structure but provides an altogether different mechanism for storage and retrieval
                of
                data.
